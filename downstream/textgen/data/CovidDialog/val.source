patient: name: brent age: 22 sex: male symptoms :  i have a cough that seems to be reccursive. it occurs usually at nightime, or if i gave a very intense sneeze or laugh. when this cough occurs, it is very dry, that it would sound like a yelping dog.   also, besides cough, i do experience a reccursive runny nose, sometimes coupled with watery red eyes and itchy throat. the runny nose discharge is transparent, almost like saliva or tears. ironically, after a while, these symptoms would disappear, and when they do disappear, i feel completely normal.  i have already consulted a doctor and was diagnosed of allergic rhinits. she adviced me to take anti histamines, either zirtec or iterax, which ever do i prefer. unfortunately, it works at often but not at all times.  how many days?:reccursive cough has been going on since april of this year. as for the runny nose, since november of last year  allergies: not that i know of,  when i was five years old, i remember being diagnosed of primary complex, but was able to be treated before it goes into something else.   also, tb runs in the family, as my uncle had it before, and so as my mom (although the doctor said it was already a scar).   as for me, 2009 was a stressful year. there were months, when my hours of daily sleep was only around 3 to four hours due to school work. also, for a period of time i was involved in smoking, although it has been a month since i stopped.  doctor, i would just like to know what are the chances of me, acquiring respiratory illness like pneumonia or tuberculosis, or development of asthma? also, if i get to consult a doctor personally with my parents, will the doctor be able to detect my past smoking habit, based on the procedures he will do, or with tests that he will recommend like xray? the truth is, i am hesitant to go to a medical clinic, because my parents have to accompany me, and i am afraid that the doctor might make "bisto" towards my parents, as they don't know that i do smoke.   but i do really want to seek medical attention. besides the incovenicence of symtpoms, i am worried that it might be something serious.   hoping for a share of your brilliant expertise.  thank you doctor and good day.

patient: my son is 3 years old, and came down with a head cold wed, it moved immediately to his chest (he is a preemie-grad, and has had trouble with pneumonia and rsv in past) he is running a temp, and his respiratory rate is between 48-50. i just don't know if i should wait it out a little longer to see what the day brings or take him in. i hate feelling like i'm always there for the slightest things with him, but his history proves medical intervention always was the case. it just seems so quick that a lung issue would be evident, when he only started showing signs of a cold wednesday night.
patient: i have been on methadone for approx. 5 years now at a dose of 30mg taken 4 times daily. this has not only stopped any unpleasant withdrawl symptoms but has also offered considerable relief in easing chronic pain from a severe back injury 11 years ago. for the first 3 years of taking the medication i found that while it was effective in these areas their was an exceptional side effect in that it absolutely obliterated any interest in sex or even the ability to physically have sex. also i found that i had next to no energy, making many things i used to enjoy fall by the wayside which in turn led to severe depression. after extensive talks with my doctor i was sent for blood analysis and it was found that my level of testosterone was so low it barely registered. i was then put on a 3 week cycle of injections of 2mls of delatestryl and for the past several years i have been the person that i used to be (it gave me my life back). know i have been given a new doctor at the clinic i attend and he has informed me that he is only there to prescribe methadone and will not be responsible for any other prescriptions. i do not have a family doctor and our emerg has said that this falls outside their domain. the walk in clinic treats every individual that i know so badly that their is no doubt in my mind that they will refuse to continue this presciption. (to give you some perspective on our walk in clinic - i went their several mnths back with sever pneumonia and the doctor looked at my chart once and told me that i would get know %$# narcotics from him and to leave immediately) any suggestions on how to get across to my knew methadone doctor (who has only been in prescribing methadone for 2 months) just how much this would severely negatively impact my life?

patient: my father 82 years old was in the hospital for pneumonia and per cardiac catherization showing blockage. it was diagnosed that blockage was too much for bypass or stent. only medication is given to help heart. heart muscles also showed dead so it was no use to have bypass surgery per cardiac physician as even if blockage removed muscles would not help heart. my question is that now released from home he has been very uncomfortable during night sleep. he moans while asleep. he gets up and sits on bed. he then lays back and the same continues. he states being tired from hospital stay. he states he is tired from stay in hospital like hospital bed etc. he really gets to sleep at 6 am and then during the day he is fine. then the next night it starts again. has been home since feb. 2. current medical doctor provided meds to sleep but that was worse. my mother is the primary caretaker and has reported his night sleep is off after returning home. does the new diagnosis cause this or is there is a reason. thanks.
