patient: i have had a percocet addiction for 35 years and have had many dr.s in that time span. i was up to without exaggeration, eating 240 10mg p s, 98 30mg oxycodone pills, as well as an assortment of 5mg pills which were always at my disposal. i have cancer and have severe back injuries but along with the p s i also had monthly access to 240 2mg xannax pills which after awhile ihad no problem eating all of the above each month and would look for some more. i died 4 times in a 6 year span due to double pneumonia which the dr.s told me my medications were playing a large roll in this. when i was 16 i became an atheist due to my brother dying, he was my favorite and i became very drug dependent to kill the pain. this lead to my later addictions and no matter what i tried i could not escape their grip.the last time i was in the hospital i said lord i do not know if you are real but if you are i am begging you to open my heart again to you and i need your help or this will probably be it for me when i leave the hospital, i have had enough, and this is only the drug portion of my life i would not wish the things and amount of death i have had to witness on anyone. i am the last of all my friends left alive and i am 53years old. over 40 friends have passed on, 2 of which i grew up with from the age of 5, others just would not listen. i lost 2 older brothers, 1 my 1st year in highschool the other 8 years later of an overdose. needless to say ptsd, depression and other problems haunted me until i did as many drugs as possible to bury the pain, but demons only stay buried so long which i found out the hard way. tiny2882@comcat,net

finish the entire bottle? i think it has 20-30 pieces. i used to lie down after a meal a few years ago like i get hungry before i go to bed then i started eating snacks and lying down. sometimes i starve myself. sometimes i wake up with acid feeling in my mouth. i don't know why i woke up this morning with chest pain, like the middle area right above the stomach and felt like i had breathing problems, breathing harder than usual, drank water and barely could eat breakfast (lasted for at least 30 minutes+). i then waited a bit after 10 minutes, drank hot water and ate breakfast, i started to breathe better again. could it be shortness or breath? may be blood pressure? esophagus issue? chest issue? heart issue? i am having weird breathing. should i be worried?
patient: hello doctor, last night i was getting chills, feeling more cold than usual and lightheaded and a lot of burping. maybe like every 30 minutes or less or so feel more chills running down my body and chest feeling bit weird like i am starting having trouble breathing then goes back to normal and repeats, with weird feeling like chills down my left and right lungs or left and right upper chest. also, my heart was pumping fast. also, some minor coughs were there since seven days ago, still here. i have white mucus and have not gotten yellow yet. i took medicines yesterday but today i got severe cold and flu medicine with a pain reliever, the chills did not go away. then today, i called the doctor on the phone and told him what happen last night and the same thing happened this morning too. i had minor coughs, feeling lightheaded, feel like maybe cannot breathe or something, and a lot of burping. i told him the burping issue was going on for at least two years, but somehow this time i am feeling lightheaded. he just gives pepcid, a try maybe gerd. i ate that today still feeling chills now and still burping a lot. right now, still some chills on arms, with breathing issue or something makes my chest feel weird and arm sometimes. so, should i be worried? i do not think i have a fever now but do not feel hot on the forehead? was it gerd or flu, it is coronavirus or something else? i hope it is not coronavirus. i am 21 years old and weigh around 110-115 kg. doctor: hello, please answer the following: any travel history in the last one month? any use of airports? any fever, have you checked the temperature? any cough? any mucus or phlegm? how is your sleep? is there any malaise or body aches or weakness? patient: thank you doctor, i travel to school, nearby grocery stores in the bus. no airport exposure. i have not checked the temperature. i do not feel hot or anything. i have minor coughs and sore throat. yes, i have mucus which seems white or clear for now. during sleep, i do not have much aches. last night i have not got much sleep, probably because i was thinking about stuff being worried, but got some sleep though. doctor: hi, most probably with the history it does not appear like a severe problem or coronavirus infection. is sore throat severe and does the pain last the whole day? do you smoke or drink? can you try taking sudafed, tylenol, and zyrtec and try getting sleep for a few days? i am sure that will make you feel better. avoid exposure to smoke dust and cold winds. keep the ac to a minimum or use ceiling fan instead. drink plenty of water and warm fluids. avoid eating out, partying. avoid unnecessary travel. you need not quarantine yourself in the strictest manner but some amount of restrictions in interacting and meeting with the community is advised. lastly, where are you currently? your place of residence and country? is it a corona endemic country? did you talk to or interact with any known or suspected flu patient? can you please take a picture of the back of the throat with open mouth showing details of the tonsils and pharyngeal wall and send it to me? patient: thank you doctor, i woke up this morning, i had trouble sleeping being worried, but i got some sleep then nearby phone ringing woke me up. so far, seems no one got any severe coughs or pain so far. i only hear minor coughs the past week or so. thanks for those medicine recommendations for sleep. i fall asleep quicker, usually, it takes me around one hour to fall asleep on most days. i will try to avoid smoking as much as possible. yes, i will be staying inside since many places are on lockdown. and school is online. i recently turned on the air purifier to clean up some air for allergies possible viruses but makes me cold. i might not need ac unless really hot. i will be staying home for the next month at least. my chills right now are feeling a bit better, but a little sick only because maybe i did not get enough sleep. i stay in san francisco ca, united states, and there are close to 40 confirmed cases around here. no severe reports near my district, and have not heard anyone in serious condition. so, last week i have a sore throat and tonsil pain while swallowing for a few days, then one day drank a lot of honey and water and some tea, then it got better. not sure if it got smaller, but the pain was less now though. between my tonsils in the middle (behind the tongue) looks like my throat, got some red stuff, maybe looks like inflamed or rashes. any recommendations? any foods or drinks that can help? doctor: hi, you have got it right. follow all the precautions. you will be alright soon. try getting a good sleep tonight. i heard about the cases in sf. my brother was supposed to fly there from india for work but his meeting got canceled in the wake of the virus. yes, your camera has not done a decent job this time around. it has not focussed on our area of interest. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). but yours has picked up the two big bumps in the back of the throat (enlarged tonsils). the tonsils could be enlarged due to the current infection and sore throat problem you are having. once the problem is resolved they should get back to their normal size, which i guess, in you, must be slightly big. the pharyngeal wall between the tonsils could be having some granular bumps which are quite common during an infection. now you do not worry, for most such infections are due to viruses (not corona). they usually get better with time and supportive treatment. traditional indian forms of medicine advise honey and hot water. tea makes a good addition i guess. sudafed and zyrtec appropriate for your weight will help additionally. tylenol every time you got pain will help you tide over this period wonderfully. now watch for some warning symptoms fever, increased pain, thick mucus, thick postnasal drip, severe malaise, swelling in the neck, etc. in such cases promptly revert to me. you may need a z pack then. patient: thank you doctor, as of now 12:40 pm i am breathing harder than usual since 30 minutes ago. i only ate some breakfast and drank water. here is my story: before feb 28th - no issues at all, besides always burping a lot, sometimes bloating, no coughs, tonsil was enlarged for a while, no lightheadedness, no breathing problems, not sick. friday february 28th - i woke up feeling unwell, drank water went back to bed, came back out super lightheaded about to faint, lied on bed for an hour, came out stomach feeling weird, even more lightheaded about to faint, can barely even eat a little noodles and two small pieces of spam, vomited it, then four more times which as water or acid. hours later was better. saturday february 29th - diarrhea sunday march 1st - diarrhea monday march 2 - diarrhea tuesday march 3 - diarrhea wednesday march 4 - no stool thursday march 3 - no more diarrhea friday march 4th - monday march 9th - no issues monday march 9th - feeling better, no problems, enlarged tonsil, no coughs really. sunday march 15 - no problems besides burping, minor coughs, some sore throat afternoon i ate chicken, burping a lot, stomach uncomfortable, felt like breathing problems, chills on hands, chest and left and right side, felt like could not breathe. 20 minutes later, still chills breathing a bit better, lightheaded kind of feel like fainting, then went to bed for 15 minutes (the breathing problem and weird chest feeling comes back randomly), ate tums, then later i drank cough and flu medicine. on monday march 16 - woke up around 11:30 am, feeling breathing problems, chills around body, lightheaded again, chest feeling weird, burping a lot, and i described my story to doctor he said it sounds like you ate something bad, does sound like gerd, of course we do not know for sure unless lab tests maybe on stool. he asked have you tried stronger antacids like pepcid or zantac? i said no. then doctor asked me to try pepcid and tell me how it goes. tuesday and wednesday march 16/17 - feeling better, no lightheadedness, no more chills, minor coughs, sore throat, burping a lot, no breathing problems so far. pepcid no problems so far besides making me burp almost all day. wednesday night still coughing a lot and drank severe cold and flu medicine. thursday march 21 i woke up fine, then once ate pepcid and drank some water, heart rate was going really fast, started to make worried, called doctor office they said can you count your beats per minute, then i counted, my phone was showing my heart rating going to 120 bpm, when i counted to them was not 120 bpm, then they told me to call back if it gets worse. then shortly after, i drank some water and ate a little bit of breakfast. my heart rate started to drop slowly and was getting better after that. friday march 20- 10 am i woke up with some chest pains (chest area above the stomach), then some coughing and feeling a little sick, little lightheaded, heart beating fast, breathing harder, felt of shortness of breath. drank some water and breathe harder, a little bit of mucus. 15-20 minutes later no more chest pains, still breathing harder. 11 am - still breathing a little bit harder than usual, coughing would make me breathe even harder. better now, but still breathing a little harder than usual. 11:30 am moving makes me breathe harder, sat in bed. 11:58 am - feeling a bit better 12:10 - feeling like breathing a harder than usual. after an hour later, feeling better now which is strange. not sure if its heart problems, acid reflux, chest issues, or esophagus. doctor: hello, always protonix is better than zantac. try using protonix (pantoprazole). do not lie down immediately after consuming meals. do not drink a lot of water after a meal. avoid spicy and oily foods. patient: thank you doctor, i went to the store to look for zantac they did not have it, so i talked to the pharmacy they said sounds like could be some weird chest tightening and the doctor said since pepcid and zantac are the same. he said to try ranitidine. right now i tried pepcid again like now, for the first five to ten minutes i think it means me feel more nervous or anxiety or something, i tried to calm myself by putting fingers on teeth. then i think now it did not cause my heart to beat super fast this time which was strange. even water makes my heart beat a little faster. should i stick with pepcid? finish the entire bottle? i think it has 20-30 pieces. i used to lie down after a meal a few years ago like i get hungry before i go to bed then i started eating snacks and lying down. sometimes i starve myself. sometimes i wake up with acid feeling in my mouth. i don't know why i woke up this morning with chest pain, like the middle area right above the stomach and felt like i had breathing problems, breathing harder than usual, drank water and barely could eat breakfast (lasted for at least 30 minutes+). i then waited a bit after 10 minutes, drank hot water and ate breakfast, i started to breathe better again. could it be shortness or breath? may be blood pressure? esophagus issue? chest issue? heart issue? i am having weird breathing. should i be worried? doctor: hi, you need to take pantoprazole or any other proton pump inhibitor. avoid heavy meals. the issue appears like a heartburn problem due to acidity only. it does not appear sinister. patient: thank you doctor, i was trying to finish the bowl of food in one hour. i was eating veggies and rice, halfway through felt something like acid may be some pain in chest and throat. feeling lightheaded so ate some meat to then coughed after.

may be blood pressure? esophagus issue? chest issue? heart issue? i am having weird breathing. should i be worried? doctor: hi, you need to take pantoprazole or any other proton pump inhibitor. avoid heavy meals. the issue appears like a heartburn problem due to acidity only. it does not appear sinister. patient: thank you doctor, i was trying to finish the bowl of food in one hour. i was eating veggies and rice, halfway through felt something like acid may be some pain in chest and throat. feeling lightheaded so ate some meat to then coughed after. doctor: hi, do not worry about it. drink plenty of water but not immediately after a meal. eat well cooked meats. patient: thank you doctor,  i really appreciate your help so much. i appreciate your time and effort to help me and give advice. only thing i am worried is just the chest pains, breathing issues and esophagus and throat stuff. i will try to wait two to three hours after eating or drinking before bed now. i hope to get less chest issues when i wake up. doctor: hi, do not worry so much. you will be absolutely alright. give it some time. if you are not getting better we can do laryngoscopy and check if there is anything wrong with the larynx. do you eat healthy food and do exercises? patient: yeah if it doesn't get better laryngoscopy would be perfect. okay, i'll give it some time thank you! i try to eat vegetables and fruits. i don't eat much junk food that much. i used to eat more junk years ago, but now mostly vegetables, fruits, meat (pork, chicken, beef, fish) usually not fried, and tried to eat whole wheat bread with fried chicken patty from the super market (for school lunch) since its cheap and its chicken (stopped now after acid problems), don't really eat french fries, pizza or drink soda etc... exercise, haven't been exercising these few months. i have been telling myself that, but then i haven't really been doing it. used to a lot years ago, now barely. since high school, when i exercise running when i try to get air feels like throat is tight or chest is tight and air is trying to squeeze its way through. after this point high school until college feels like i'm not breathing enough air. when i was younger (elementary/middle school) felt like i gotten a lot more air then now through my throat and air doesn't squeezes through. one doctor just used stethoscope for heart and lungs, told me to breathe hasn't said much about it. then another doctor said, sounds you are not breathing that much, feels like not getting another air (in high school, like 4-6 years ago maybe), they didn't do much about it. so, when i try to breath regularly, seems like not much air comes out through mouth even before acid reflux,.that's why recent breathing problems kinda worry me, but anyways yeah like that.

patient: i was given amoxycillin for a chest infection and did not improve after 48 hours, therefore i went back to the gp who then gave me clarythmomycin as it resulted in pneumonia. i have been off work for 3 weeks now and feel completely washed out and exhausted. i had a chest x-ray which was clear, but was given an inhaler temporarily as i was out of breath and wheezy. i still have an incredible amount of phlegm which has now changed from brown to sometimes green to clear. unfortunately, for last 3 days, my trachea is extremely bruised to touch and feel as if someone is pressing my windpipe. although my tonsils aren t swollen, my ear hurts deep inside. i have had to start taking paracetamol again this week as feel weak, wobbly and feel as if i am going backwards again instead of improving. i am 45 years old. non-smoker.this is the 3rd time i have had pneumonia in 18 years. i am reasonably fit and healthy, and i don t suffer from colds normally, but whenever i come down with something, i seem to suffer with it. how long does it take to get back to normal? are the trachea symptoms part of the initial pneumonia symptoms or would i need to see the gp again. i am feeling extremely fed up of generally feeling unwell. i am taking a tonic (metatone) and drinking and eating healthily. basically, is it normal to feel this unwell for so long.
