yes, maybe, maybe. we presume one is immune to a respiratory virus for a while after getting the infection (that's the way it is with other viruses). a few people have trouble with their antibodies and don't have much immunity. shedding of viruses sometimes is longer than 14 days. in life, there will always be some people who get reinfected, for whatever reason. usually one is immune after the infection. (3/21/20)
thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern. repeated spiking temperatures (fever) in pneumonia patient is suggestive of nonresolving pneumonia.so better to consult pulmonologist and get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. culture report will isolate the causative organism (if it is mrsa or other bacteria) and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment.he may need higher antibiotics on the basis of sensitivity report. by this, we can achieve speedy recovery. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your friend. thanks.

hello and welcome to ‘ask a doctor’ service.i have reviewed your query and here is my advice.pneumococcal vaccine is protective against 23 types of streptococcus pneumonia bacteria. this bacteria is the most common organism (80% cases) for pneumonia.but there are other bacterias which can cause pneumonia. and in such cases, pneumococcal vaccine is not protective.so you and your brother might be having some other bacterial pneumonia. second-hand smoking is also a contributing factor to your pneumonia.hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards,dr. kaushal bhavsar
thanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. in my opinion, you need higher antibiotic,inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ics) for your current symptoms. constant coughing at night can be due to worsening of pneumonia or bronchitis. so consult pulmonologist and get done chest x ray and pft (pulmonary function test). chest x ray is for pneumonia and pft is for bronchitis. don't worry, you will be alright with all these. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.
hello and welcome to ‘ask a doctor’ service.i have reviewed your query and here is my advice.imodium is having loperamide. it is not a good drug for diarrhea. so you should not take it. you should definitely take probiotics as they are the first line treatment for diarrhea. along with probiotics, eat more curd and yogurt. avoid oily and spicy food. avoid junk food. drink oral re-hydration solution (ors) and zinc tablet. don't worry, you will be alright with all these. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards, dr. kaushal bhavsar
consider chest image. pneumonia may occur and if you continue to spike fevers, please see your pcp for a chest image and reevaluation. testing for additional bacterial and viral causes may be performed at the same time. stay at home at least for three days after the fever has broken and avoid contact with others. .
hello and welcome to ‘ask a doctor’ service.i have reviewed your query and here is my advice.pneumonia causes pleurisy (inflammation of pleura). so chest pain is commonly seen with pneumonia and anti-inflammatory painkiller drugs like paracetamol or ibuprofen should be tried. you can also apply warm water pad on affected areas of the chest. once your pneumonia is cured, your pain will definitely subside. mucinex is a good drug for pneumonia. it actually dilutes the secretions and made them easy to cough out. so continue with mucinex. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards,      dr. kaushal bhavsar
viral physiology. hiv is a virus that exists to replicate and increase its numbers, primarily, it’s just how the virus functions, prioritizes replication over other functions. i’m sure there is more complex immunologic answer from a specialist in infectious diseases.
hard to guess. if you are living in an area affected with covid-19 pandemic certainly it arouse suspicion if you are infected. your age is aginst criteria. it may well be what you have is bronchitis or flu. isolate yourself and get in touch with your doctor preferably via telemedicine to find out about where you can be tested and your treatment path forward. .

thanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. in my opinion, her diarrhoea is mostly due to amoxicillin. amoxicillin can cause diarrhea on second exposure. so you should stop amoxicillin. there are options for oral antibiotics other than amoxicillin like cefixime, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin etc. and left basal pneumonia means lung infection in lower lobe of left lung. so antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your mother.thanks.
in brief: covid 19 tests you can be tested either at any of the private labs or at selected government clinics. you need to meet the criteria for testing before it is done. would you like to video or text chat with me?

thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern. in my opinion, you are mostly having bronchospasm which is causing this suffocating feeling. pneumonia causes inflammation in airways and this in turn causes bronchospasm. so in my opinion, you should ask your doctor about starting inhaled bronchodilators like formoterol or salmeterol to relieve bronchospasm. also avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. don't worry, you will be alright with all these. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.

take care. 1. wash your hands2. stay home as much as you can3. control your glucose levels4. meditate or search for breathing exercises.
hello,to be honest, there is a chance of cross infection from one person to another. however, this depends on so many factors and most of the infections, especially bacterial pneumonia, do not transmit easily. if more than one arm distance, the chance is very little and if not too close (like kissing etc.) the chance is further reduced. if two of them are already on antibiotics, as in your case, there is a chance but in the setting what u described, it is extremely unlikely. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards,      dr. mahboob ur rahman
hello and welcome to ‘ask a doctor’ service.i have reviewed your query and here is my advice.as per your history and description, the possibility of end-stage heart disease leads to heart failure is more likely. surgical treatment is best for this. so try to get it done urgently as soon as possible.diuretics and other cardiac supportive drugs are advisable until surgery. so better to consult the cardiologist and try for early surgery.hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards,dr. kaushal bhavsar
thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern. for diagnosis of pneumonia, chest x ray need to have infiltration.with normal chest x ray, pneumonia is not possible. cough, congestion, crackles on auscultation are also seen with bronchitis. and bronchitis shows normal chest x ray too.so it is quite possible that you improve within antibiotic because antibiotics also work in bronchitis. so i don't think you are having pneumonia because your chest x ray is normal. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.
yes, but... bacteria are living creatures, like the rest of us. viruses are missing some parts so are not living unless they are inside another living creature. viruses that are by themselves are dormant like seeds or spores, waiting to be reactivated. in a general sense, it is fine to think of viruses as living things, but technically speaking, they are not independently living when alone.
in brief: +- covid19 (see bel) there are multiple causes of those symptoms, including covid 19, but only go for a test if,1. you have traveled to high risk countries in the last 2-4 weeks2. you have had +ve contact with a known +ve covid 19 case3. if you have a high fever with your sore throat + severe headache + dry cough.hope that helps.rgdsdr wayne korras would you like to video or text chat with me?
not particularly. the facts are your nose & upper airway add humidity to the air you breathe to the point it reaches ~100% at the level of air exchange. vaporizers help loosen thicker mucus in the upper airways so you can cough it up, but it would not have any effect on the deep airways or any germs that reach them. .
thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern. swimming pool water is full of organisms. so possibility of relapse of pneumonia is more likely because your symptoms, coughing, wheezing, chest pain are more suggestive of pneumonia. so consult your doctor and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray. if chest x ray is showing fresh infiltrates then you will need another course of antibiotics, mucolytic and expectorant drugs. avoid swimming for atleast 1 month.hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.
booster vaccinations. you should have had a booster at 12 years and that lasts for 10 years. if your last tdap was at 6yrs then you are overdue. i agree with waiting for after the covid pandemic unless you have an injury that would require tetanus immunity. stay safe. .
contact your doctor. in the mean time self quarantine yourself. if you do not have a doctor call your local health resources to find out where you can be tested. it may be difficult to come by a testing location in some countries.
in brief: yes call your doctor for advise. would you like to video or text chat with me?
in brief: telephonic consult? could well be another respiratory virus, i would stay home for now. use this platform to consult either virtually or ask more questions. use home medicine - decongestant and pain medication. stay away from any anti-inflammatories if possible. keep up warm fluids. would you like to video or text chat with me?

in brief: cough of covid-19 in covid-19, cough is usually dry, persistent (initially not much different from a cold), then turns into wet with mucus and high fever (pneumonia). in severe cases, severe shortness of breath and oxygen desaturation can develop after the pneumonia (severe respiratory distress syndrome). would you like to video or text chat with me?
in brief: lab if necessary most commercial labs such as lancet, ampath and pathcare can test. but the labs are stretched and test kits in short supply. only tests if:you have symptoms that are not resolvingyou have been in contact with someone diagnosed with covid-19you have traveled from a high risk area would you like to video or text chat with me?
thanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. radiological resolution takes 2-3 weeks in pneumonia. so it is possible that patient of pneumonia is improved symptomatically but still show pneumonia on chest x ray. so in my opinion, you should should waiting for 2 weeks more. get done repeat chest x ray after 2 weeks.if chest x ray is showing pneumonia then go for ct thorax and bronchoscopy to rule out lung cancer, tuberculosis, fungal pneumonia. if xun4 ray is improving then no need to worry. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your mother. thanks.
thanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. bronchiectesis is permanently damaged part of lung. so bacterial colonization is common in bronchiectesis. and this gives repeated pneumonia attacks. so best and permanent cure for this is surgical removal of bronchiectic part of lung. so consult cardio thoracic surgeon and discuss about surgical removal. another option is culture and sensitivity based treatment. get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. culture will identify the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your friend. thanks.
thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern.you have given oral antibiotic for pneumonia.this itself suggests that you are had walking pneumonia (no serious type).levofloxacin is broad spectrum antibiotic and usually sufficient for walking pneumonia.so if you are don't have fever or coughing at present and feel good then you can definitely fly. no harm in it.hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.

hello gigi !coughing up blood with sputum (henoptysis) is a red flag sign .. meaning to say it definitely needs medical attention . considering you have had tb in the past there are many possibilities for your present episodes of hemoptysis. it could me a bacterial infection or relapse of tb or post tb bronchiectasis (abnormal permanent dilation of your airways at few places which happens when they get damaged due to your past tb). take a course of antibiotic as prescribed by your physician ,consult with your physician and discuss about taking drugs like tranexemic acid which reduce the bleeding tendency , cough suppressants . while sleeping, lie on the side which was previously affected by tb and be on complete bed rest . once your hemoptysis gets controlled go for sputum examination to check for tb bacilli , chest x ray and if needed hrct thorax (to pick up bronchiectasis which can sometimes be not evident on x ray). since u mentioned severe back pain , vascular abnormalities concerning the descending aorta (the major blood vessel carrying blood from the heart)needs to be also considered treatment is to be decided based on the cause for your hemoptysis.do review with your physician and get the necessary investigations done.
in brief: if you are dying everything is in motion and medical decisions are fluid, so you won't know until it happens. that's because a healthy person under 50 won't die (has maybe half a percent chance of dying) from covid-19, but a guy aged 70-80 has a 7-8% chance of dying from this... about the same as a non-elderly diabetic. that means the old guy and the diabetic both have about a 92-93% chance of not dying. (3/25/20) would you like to video or text chat with me?
in brief: urgent care! you must go to an urgent care center or emergency room as soon as possible to have an exam at which time lab tests & a chest x-ray should be ordered to help determine your diagnosis. the sooner you are properly evaluated & treated the better! i wish you well with your health! would you like to video or text chat with me?
thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern. in my opinion, you should take her to sgpgi, lucknow and consult pulmonologist there.she needs bronchoscopy, bal (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis and tblb (trans bronchial lung biopsy).bal analysis will identify the causative organism for pneumonia. tblb is needed to rule out lung cancer. don't worry, she will be alright. first diagnose her and then start appropriate treatment. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your mother. thanks.
better to skip. the protective gear is not protectve enough to prepare food.
alcohol for covid-19. washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is extremely effective. using an alcohol based hand sanitizer is a good second line of defense. sanitizer contains emollient to help prevent dehydration. straight alcohol doesn't. follow all of the other published rules.
viral infection. most likely a non-specific viral infection.check your temperature.if persistently raised an symptoms don't clear in 7 days, consult your doctor.most likely a non-specific viral infection.only be concerned about covid-19 if:you have been in contact with someone with a conformed diagnosis of covid-19you have visited a high risk areasymptoms worsen and include persistent fever and dry cough.

covid-19? it sounds like your mom is in good hands. if she has covid, they will know how to treat it. if the pneumonia is beleived to be bacterial, they will treat with antibiotics. there is no proved effective treatment for coronavirus itself. ask her doctors if she is a candidate for remdesivir -- not proved effective but sometimes available on a "compassionate" basis for severely ill patients. good luck.
in brief: call your doctor call your doctor's office for instructions would you like to video or text chat with me?

diabetes and covid. in all cases, the better the blood sugar is controlled, the better the immune system can function. eating healthy, exercising as tolerated, and control blood sugars are close to normal as your doctor advises, is the best plan. .
sounds risky. using symptoms of fever, cough, or runny nose to screen for covid-19 is not accurate because colds and flu have such symptoms. covid testing is by nasal swab, but there's a shortage of test kits in this pandemic. only local resources know local testing sites, times, restrictions. even a negative test does not guarantee one does not have covid-19. safest for people to stay away from icu patients.
thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern. possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more likely. bronchitis (inflammation of airways) is common after pneumonia.and persistent dry cough and chest pain are mostly due to bronchitis.so better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and pft (pulmonary function test).pft will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. you will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ics) (budesonide or fluticasone).don't worry, you will be alright with all these. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.
depends on severity. covid-19 pandemic at this time, so a doctor on video may consult by video instead of requiring an in-person visit. flu-like symptoms can be from a strep throat infection, a cold or influenza, or from some other cause like covid-19. usually, a person calls the doctor if the symptoms are bothersome, serious, recurrent, or persistent. covid-19 testing depends on local availability.

in brief: eye pain eye pain can be for various reasons. bilateral eye pain would be less likely foreign body although dusts can cause this. conjunctivitis can be bilateral from either bacteria, virus or allergies. light exposure can cause eye irritation. would you like to video or text chat with me?
in brief: test if can don't go to a public space, consult via the telephone or get a coronavirus test would you like to video or text chat with me?
respected user , hi thanks for using healthcaremagic.comi have evaluated your query thoroughly .* all symptoms are in relation with underlying lung condition giving rise to broncho alveolar constrictions , pleura irritation with systemic manifestations* as there is not much relief of oral medications given till now , i strongly recommend to get hospitalised treatment & early better recovery through iv antibiotics , bronchodilators, supportive nursing care hope this clears your querywelcome for any further assistance regards .

in brief: covid-19 criteria do you have any medical conditions that would put you at high risk? if so, i would book a virtual consult with a dr. if not, we are not currently testing due to lack of capacity if there is no fever, dry cough & shortness of breath with travel history. i would treat for flu and complete 14 days (possibly longer if still sick) quarantine and contact a dr if condition changes would you like to video or text chat with me?
thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern. pneumococcal vaccine is live attenuated vaccine. so it is contraindicated in active infections like pneumonia because it can flare up infection. so better not to take pneumococcal vaccine at present. get complete cure from current pneumonia and then take pneumococcal vaccine. don't worry if time period between two vaccine is more than 5 years.hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.
in brief: if that is all you have by now you don't have the chinese virus. would you like to video or text chat with me?
probably not. fever and cough, headache, body aches are much more common. please follow your symptoms, treat appropriately. honey in hot tea, gargle with salt water, suck hard candy. secrets/cepachol losenges should decrease symptoms. good luck.
more detail. do you have a temperature ?have you traveled internationally or locally?do you have a fever ?it is seeming to be becoming necessary to be more vigilant about covid-19.i suggest you make an appointment to see a doctor.
unlikely. follow this guideline, but i do not see evidence you need to isolate. https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines/preventing-covid-19.
telephonic consult. get tested but you need to consult first, telephonically and get access to a test if you can, stay at home treat with panado only and a lot of fluids, rest :)
hello and welcome to ‘ask a doctor’ service. i have reviewed your query and here is my advice.  in my opinion, you should definitely consult pulmonologist for this pain. you will need a chest x-ray and pft (pulmonary function test). a chest x-ray is needed to rule out recurrence of pneumonia because this can also cause similar kind of pain. pft is needed to know the severity of asthma. you may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ics) (budesonide or fluticasone). don't worry, you will be alright with all these.   hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.
without any details it's impossible to say.
in brief: basically the hpv virus is transferred within fluids generated during intercourse. a mechanical skin contact appears to be part of the process but defining the exact amount of contact required is difficult. the genital strains of hpv are specific to those locations. there are other hpv strains that cause things like skin warts but these are different. would you like to video or text chat with me?
in brief: yes i would advise screening due to your exposure. fever is very commonly associated with covid-19. stay at home, rest, drink fluids and monitor your temperature. arrange the testing which also may include a chest image with your pcp. since your have been traveling, a pulmonary embolism is another possible cause of your shortness of breath. would you like to video or text chat with me?
in brief: question you have not posted a question. would you like to video or text chat with me?
in brief: very unlikely it sounds more like a viral cold. covid does not present this way. treat the symptoms,consult gp if worse or if sputum changes color. would you like to video or text chat with me?
in brief: yes it helps to keep the body in good shape and good nutrition.
covid-19 symptoms. nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occur fairly frequently early in the infection, but are rarely if ever the only symptoms. if cough and fever don't develop within a day or two after vomiting or diarrhea, probably it isn't covid-19.
in brief: water and soap it is best, providing available easily. trying not to touch shared places would also protect to some extent. would you like to video or text chat with me?
hard to say. is the mucous coloured or clear? try to access health advice as you are. stay home. it could be covid but if you are fairly asymptomatic stay home and keep asking questions on this platform. it is safer for you and others. treat symptomatically for now. and keep asking on here.
covid 19. dear patient.what is your concern/ symptoms?dr wil.
safer to quarantine. screening procedures to identify who has covid-19 are not very reliable and vary depending on location (city, county, state, nation) and entity type (airline boarding, border control, clinic, school, etc.). three months into the epidemic, the safest is to self-quarantine for 14-21 days upon arrival. reliable test for virus is via nasal swab, but there's a shortage of test kits in most places.
in brief: many causes. most cases of covid-19 with symptoms are associated with fever, however milder cases do occur. your shortness of breath and difficulty breathing may have a number of causes and should be evaluated. please call your pcp. avoid dust, mold, smoke, animal dander, pollen. your symptoms also are consistent with an allergic reaction. would you like to video or text chat with me?
stay home. family members should stay home and avoid contact with your brother. keep linens, bath area and utensils separated. he should monitor his temperature, drink fluids, rest and your family should be screened for coronavirus.
in brief: source of bleeding there are many causes of the small amount of blood in your sputum. you may have a nasal or upper airway source. strep infection, influenza are possible causes. covid-19 typically is associated with fever, dry cough and/or shortness of breath.. please contact your pcp for an evaluation, possible chest image and evaluation of the source of the bleeding. would you like to video or text chat with me?
hello,since, you are feeling better after albuterol (inhaled bronchodilator), possibility of bronchitis (inflammation of airways) is more likely for your symptoms.bronchitis is common after lung infection (pneumonia). so, it is better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and pft (pulmonary function test).pft will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.you will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ics) (budesonide or fluticasone).hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards,dr. kaushal bhavsar

covid-19 and ra. some anecdotal data showed that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine might have activity against covid-19. observation from china wuhan noted that patients with ra and on these medications had low incidence of covid-19 infection. there is however no definite proof yet at this time. in terms of whether you can stop methotrexate, you better discuss with your rheumatologist for the benefit and risk. .
hello and welcome to ‘ask a doctor’ service. i have reviewed your query and here is my advice.  according to the history it might be a viral situation or an allergy. don't worry so much she is under medical control.  regards   dr.jolanda
in brief: not enough tests aside from really sick people and hospitalized patients, there aren't enough pcr viral tests in the us. for now, we tell people that if they are healthy, just keep 6 feet from other people, and remember that high-touch objects have viruses. if people have any symptoms, even just sniffles, they isolate themselves, and call their doctors if having moderate or worsening symptoms. (3/23/20) would you like to video or text chat with me?
yes. everyone with flu like symptoms should be tested for covid19. test is becoming more widely available in the united states as the pandemic worsens.
in brief: coronavirus lives new coronavirus may live on surfaces for a few hours or a few days depending on the type of surface, temperature or humidity. one report indicated that new coronavirus can survive on hard surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours. would you like to video or text chat with me?
watch and wait. with very mild symptoms you do not need to be tested.your temperature is important. if your symptoms worsen or a fever develops or you start coughing and shortness of breath you need to seek help. stay home and treat the symptoms with paracetamol.
no. the coronavirus apparently only needs to be in contact with the mucosa of the lips, mouth, nose and eyes to infect someone.please stay home and follow the recommendations of the local authorities.
in brief: yes i am unaware of any contraindication to using bcp and the virus. would you like to video or text chat with me?
respected user, hi i evaluated whole long query in total details thoroughly .* now only options left for you is holistic healing with herbs & other things.* current respiratory details & status are not mentioned with symptoms to figure out for the pneumonia, but for mental condition i can say that only & only thing which can help you to any extent is very deep meditation sessions on highly regular basis 2-3 hours of dedicated yoga daily which will give your inner soul & subcouncious mind the level of peace you are lacking at present .hope this helps you .welcome for any further assistance .thanks for using healthcaremagic.com & giving me an opportunity to assistwishing you a healthy life ahead .regards dear take care.
in brief: death at 38 your risk of death from the virus is low. if you diabetes is controlled you should not have particularly higher risk. poorly controlled diabetes would make a difference. would you like to video or text chat with me?
7 days. stay at home for 7 days without symptoms. monitor your temperature, rest, drink fluids if symptoms develop, please notify your physician and test. .
do you have diagnosed it correctly ? go for hrct chest , or bronchoscopy for same. take i.v. antibiotics and then oral. complete course of antibiotics. for costochondritis apply analgesics ointment on it along with systemic anti inflammatory drugs. get done diagnosis proper. you will definitely able to work again.
in brief: it may help. coronavirus infections may make individuals more susceptible to catching other viral or bacterial infections, esp. if there are underlying respiratory conditions such as asthma or copd, cardiac conditions or immunocompromised states. flu vaccines may afford a certain level of protection to kids, but they do not protect against all strains of the influenza virus. would you like to video or text chat with me?
corona. i am unaware of any data that suggests the virus causes heart problems. the primary cause of death has been respiratory infections which lead to pneumonia and ards. older smokers the most susceptible. now, in that group other comorbid problems include renal failure and cardiac events. at 34 stick with standard precautions to prevent disease. .
hello, please answer the following: any travel history in the last one month? any use of airports? any fever, have you checked the temperature? any cough? any mucus or phlegm? how is your sleep? is there any malaise or body aches or weakness?
hi, most probably with the history it does not appear like a severe problem or coronavirus infection. is sore throat severe and does the pain last the whole day? do you smoke or drink? can you try taking sudafed, tylenol, and zyrtec and try getting sleep for a few days? i am sure that will make you feel better. avoid exposure to smoke dust and cold winds. keep the ac to a minimum or use ceiling fan instead. drink plenty of water and warm fluids. avoid eating out, partying. avoid unnecessary travel. you need not quarantine yourself in the strictest manner but some amount of restrictions in interacting and meeting with the community is advised. lastly, where are you currently? your place of residence and country? is it a corona endemic country? did you talk to or interact with any known or suspected flu patient? can you please take a picture of the back of the throat with open mouth showing details of the tonsils and pharyngeal wall and send it to me?
hi, you have got it right. follow all the precautions. you will be alright soon. try getting a good sleep tonight. i heard about the cases in sf. my brother was supposed to fly there from india for work but his meeting got canceled in the wake of the virus. yes, your camera has not done a decent job this time around. it has not focussed on our area of interest. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). but yours has picked up the two big bumps in the back of the throat (enlarged tonsils). the tonsils could be enlarged due to the current infection and sore throat problem you are having. once the problem is resolved they should get back to their normal size, which i guess, in you, must be slightly big. the pharyngeal wall between the tonsils could be having some granular bumps which are quite common during an infection. now you do not worry, for most such infections are due to viruses (not corona). they usually get better with time and supportive treatment. traditional indian forms of medicine advise honey and hot water. tea makes a good addition i guess. sudafed and zyrtec appropriate for your weight will help additionally. tylenol every time you got pain will help you tide over this period wonderfully. now watch for some warning symptoms fever, increased pain, thick mucus, thick postnasal drip, severe malaise, swelling in the neck, etc. in such cases promptly revert to me. you may need a z pack then.
hello, always protonix is better than zantac. try using protonix (pantoprazole). do not lie down immediately after consuming meals. do not drink a lot of water after a meal. avoid spicy and oily foods.
hi, you need to take pantoprazole or any other proton pump inhibitor. avoid heavy meals. the issue appears like a heartburn problem due to acidity only. it does not appear sinister.
hi, do not worry about it. drink plenty of water but not immediately after a meal. eat well cooked meats.
hi, do not worry so much. you will be absolutely alright. give it some time. if you are not getting better we can do laryngoscopy and check if there is anything wrong with the larynx. do you eat healthy food and do exercises?
i guess you are in the right track. with regards to food diet and exercise. restart doing your exercise. keep yourself active. try having more than three meals a day but keep the quantity of each meal less than the usual. that way you eat more frequently but without putting weight or adding unnecessary calories.
in brief: may do video consult covid-19 pandemic at this time, so one's doctor may want to consult by video instead of requiring an in-person visit. some medications are refillable by video, others are not. in this pandemic, one's primary care doctor, who knows the patient well, can usually get meds to the patient without an in-person visit... unless an exam is needed in order to adjust the meds. just ask the doctor. would you like to video or text chat with me?
primarily he suffering reflux disease which causes repeated aspiration and pneumonia so correction of underlying pathology will resolve pneumonia and as for concern about antibiotic and treatment of pneumonia use of antibiotics for prolong period can cause development of resistant organisms
in brief: phone triage. call your gp's office for instructions and identify local resources. your symptoms are suggesting sinusitis (other causes still possible) that is frequently viral and self limited. local regulations should also be followed in such circumstances. self quarantine will work for all in trying to prevent the spread. hydration and rest will also work regardless of what the cause for your symptoms is. would you like to video or text chat with me?
in brief: no you are not more than the next person :) relax self isolate would you like to video or text chat with me?
it depends... due to limited availability of covid testing, you probably wouldn’t meet criteria for testing, unless you develop fever or cough, and you have chronic health problems or have been possibly exposed to covid.seek care right away if difficulty breathing or severe symptoms.seek online or phone consultation otherwise, to avoid exposure.ultimately, patients who need treatment will have lung symptoms.
real vs. textbook. real-life criteria is different because we don't have enough tests, supplies, or medical staff around the world at this time (march 2020). textbook criteria are suspected covid in hospitalized persons or in those with underlying medical conditions; or persons who got symptoms less than 14 days after (1) contact with a suspect or confirmed covid patient or (2) travel through high-risk covid area.
thanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. small cell lung cancer is commonly caused by cigarette smoking. actually cigarette smoke causes irritation to lung mucosa. chronic irritation causes structural and genetic changes which leads to malignant nodule. this nodule grows with time and forms mass like lesion. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. thanks.
hello, i understand your concern. i just have a few more questions. does your cough has phlegm? any other symptoms like difficulty breathing? any other medical condition such as asthma, hypertension? are you a smoker? alcoholic beverage drinker?
hi, i would recommend you take n-acetylcysteine 200 mg powder dissolved in water three times a day. you may also nebulize using pnss (saline nebulizer) three times a day. this will help the phlegm to come out. i would also recommend you take vitamin c 500 mg and zinc to boost your immune system. if symptoms persist, worsen or new onset of symptoms has been noted, further consult is advised.
in brief: do you have access if you have access to testing you can be tested, more importantly have you had contact with someone who is postive htat you know, have you travelled?do you have a fever? would you like to video or text chat with me?
not yet. only if your respiration rate (google that) per minute goes above 25 and you really feel you are battling to breath. use this forum if your symptoms change. we are here for you.
the symptom pattern is not specific to one agent. it suggests a cold and ear infection. kids have been among those least affected by covid-19 . only proper screening and testing could confirm or exclude this or any other agent. parainfluenza, rhinovirus, or rsv would be more likely.
screening test if. if you develop symptoms of dry cough, fever and/or shortness of breath, consider re testing since the test may convert to a positive test if infected. other causes should be considered including an allergic reaction. try one dose of an antihistamine and gauge improvement. stay at home for three days if there is no fever. .
hello dear jean , hiwarm welcome to healthcaremagic.comi have evaluated your query in details .* the urine color is in relation with side effect of penicillin , not a part of pneumonia .* has to be addressed immediately to your treating doctor for this issue .wishing you fine recovery .welcome for any further guidance .regards .
hello,any infection if severe can suppress bone marrow. and this is responsible for low wbc (white blood cells) count. so better to start injectable antibiotics for control of infection. she may need leucovorin injection to stimulate bone marrow for producing wbcs. once her infection is controlled, she will have a normal wbc count. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards,dr. kaushal bhavsar
in brief: vte i am unaware that vte (venous thromboembolism) is associated with increased risk for severe infection. keep in mind at 42 your risk is low for severe infection. otherwise do not smoke or start. consider vitamin d3 and vitamin c and make sure you stay active. also social distancing is not social isolation. remember this too will pass! would you like to video or text chat with me?
in brief: can give dr. a call. throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza (antibiotics usually not used), or from other causes such as allergies, irritants, or covid-19. usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. covid-19 tends to have cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain would you like to video or text chat with me?
break. at 39 your risk for severe infections is very low. a strategy that i recommend is taking in information daily, but get away from it. practice prudent precautions. in my off times away from er (still practicing front line er) i focus my mind on my cooking, planning my garden, engage with my friends and loved ones and read.
possible virus. this is likely a viral infection. if you have a fever and/or the cough or sore throat get worse, you should be examined by your doctor. if you've been exposed to a particular illness, such as strep or the flu or coronavirus, you may need to be tested.for now, rest, drink fluids, take acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed if you have no medical contraindication.
covid and tb. patients with a history of underlying lung disease do have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality with covid infection. it is important to self isolate and maintain social distancing as per the current protocols. should you suspect covid infection get screened as early as possible.
in brief: unlikely not at this point. treat what you have currently symptomatically. stock up now whilst not yet on lockdown. i don't feel that you qualify for a covid test right now. keep posting your questions.
in brief: unknown without any details it's impossible to say. would you like to video or text chat with me?
in brief: covid19 even though your have no fever or shortness of breath, your travel history fits criteria to be tested. i suggest you get tested for covid19 - speak with your gp to advise further, self isolate in the meanwhile would you like to video or text chat with me?
conflicting info. i have seen articles on both sides of using advil or motrin. personally i would recommend not using it because side effects, interactions and complications from nsaids in general. acetaminophen is safer.
in brief: covid-19 this may be influenza or covid 19 and warrants a call to your physician to get instructions of whether to be examined,cultured and/or tested for covid 19 virus, ordered to have a chest xray and/or started, on antibiotics. a lot depends on whether you're in an endemic area or have been exposed to someone who has the infection or had travelled from an affected region. gargle,avoid dehydration. would you like to video or text chat with me?
perhaps not now. see how you go, going out right now is really a big risk. we are here and can communicate during the lockdown period. the government are making more tests available and safely so. trust our government. stay home right now.
in brief: covid 19 the incubation period of covid 19 is 2-14 days and you're past that. however if fever, chills, heavier cough, or breathing difficulties develop, call your md for instructions. for now, drink adequate fluids, gargle with warm salt water. i recommend also using zinc lozenges and take acetaminophen. don't infect others regardless of what type of infection you have. would you like to video or text chat with me?
hey brent,if you feeling low and drowsy with pneumonia then you must take appropriate antibiotics.if required might get admitted to get done i.v. treatment.
rash. how long has it been going on? may be food allergies, most common are dairy products so you could try a week with no dairy and see if there is a change, others allergens include eggs , wheat. could try zyrtec children's 2 ml once a day and see if it helps itching. rarely i have seen strep manifest with rash for which you need a culture. speak to a pediatrician on healthtap prime or call md.
less likely nt immun. your body will develop antibodies against the virus but depending on how strong you keep your immune system, it is possible to get it again if you're re-exposed with a weak immune system .
it actually works. as does washing your hands with soap and water. all the germs die after using it, so they become harmless. sanitizer and washing your hands will help protect you, but you can still catch covid-19 through your mouth and nose and inhaled into the lungs. social distance and quarantine as needed.
hello and welcome to ‘ask a doctor’ service. i have reviewed your query and here is my advice.  recurrent chest infections in asthma patients can cause bronchitis. so better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and pft (pulmonary function test). pft will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. you will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ics) (budesonide or fluticasone). don't worry, you will be alright with all these.   hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further.   wish you good health!   thanks.
lung whiteout and loss of heart outline are findings of chest x-ray compatible with many abnormal conditions affecting the lungs, like pneumonia, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome among others. in the actual setting, your father is already receiving treatment to his pneumonia. all the other possibilities are probably been considerated and adressed by ccu staff. weaning from mechanical ventilation is sometimes challenging because many factors can impair patients evolution, like how long he's been in mv, his nutrition status, his cardiovascular performance and resolution of the cause that led him to mv in the first place.
protection. stay at home as much as possible, clean your hands and your children hands after any contact with people, alcohol is very helpful; avoid touching your face when you are not sure your hands are clean. in crowded places, wear protection like n95 surgical mask. playing outside is ok, but apply these measures and stay way 6 ft from any unknown health status person.
in brief: uri your symptoms are consistent with a flu like upper respiratory tract infection. treatment would be resting, drinking adequate fluids and taking acetaminophen. chest discomfort or shortness of breath would be concerning and if you've been exposed to anyone with covid19, who has been in an affected region or if you live in a region where covid19 is present, notify your md and get tested. would you like to video or text chat with me?
respected sir, hi. diagnosis of pertussis is clinical usually,divided into 3 stages .1st stage (catarrhal) where runny nose, sneezing, low grade fever, occasional cough. 2nd stage (paroxysmal) bursts of coughing or numerous rapid coughs, difficult to expel thick mucus from airways in lungs , long respiratory effort with high-pitch breath sound , individual may have cyanosis with or without vomiting during severe attack, inbetween attacks, patient becomes normal.3rd stage is convalescent or recovery gradually from above all. overall period may range from 1-2 weeks to 10-12 weeks. in which cases diagnosis is not certain or require confirmation *culture of bacterium bordetella pertusis from nasal secretions *pcr test identifying genetic material from the bacterium in nasal secretions. hope this clears your query dear madam, thanks regards take care, bye, wishing you fast speedy recovery from the same.
thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern.yes, possibility of pneumonia is more.children don't show high grade fever sometimes.vomiting can be seen in pneumonia. chest congestion is classical symptom of pneumonia in children.so better to take her to pediatrician and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray.she may need antibiotics and other supportive drugs.hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your daughter. thanks.
in brief: nearly normal assuming you are not on any immunosuppresive therapy your risk is normal. but make sure you do social distancing would you like to video or text chat with me?
bacterial likely. use nasal saline rinses, a nasal steroid and discuss the use of augmentin for 10 days with your pcp. it is more likely that you have a bacterial infection. an examination of your mouth or uploaded photo to a ht virtual consultation is important. avoid smoke and if you are a smoker, please consider a biopsy of the area. .
in brief: test since there is a risk for coronavirus, please stay home, rest and drink fluids. monitor for symptoms including fever, dry cough and/or shortness of breath. avoid contact with others and consider testing. the symptoms of covid 19 may be very mild. travel is one risk factor for acquiring the disease. would you like to video or text chat with me?
hopefully not. your wife should know the protocol of handle covid-19 as well as other viruses. her institution should be providing ppe (personal protective equipment) for her to use properly.
tingling in extremities may be a sign of peripheral neuropathy, wich is most of the cases caused by inflammatory injury to the nerves. anti-tnf drugs, such as humira, have been reported to be associated to this kind of injury, that can be potentialized when associated to steroids. you should visit your attending rheumathologist for physical evaluation and apropriate management.
hello,the most possible issue here is systemic manifestation of underlying infection in form of sepsis, side effects of medicines currently used or others.in our clinic, we recommend thorough work up with lab tests and guide to manage in accordance.hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards,dr. bhagyesh v. patel

fever. hiit sounds like a viral infection with temp , headache and cough.the urine and pain down there does not sounds related, but if it is, it can be a bacterial infection, for which you need antibiotics.are you taking enough fluids?what meds have you taken so far?.
monitor temp. most cases of covid-19 are associated with symptoms, but not all. your symptoms may be related to coronavirus infection or another infection. i would recommend that you be tested for coronavirus and then stay inside, avoiding contact with others while awaiting your test results. use good hand washing, disinfect surfaces and drink fluids.
in brief: wait my advice would be wait and don't risk exposure and spread right now. quarantine. safe stay. we are here for you on this platform. would you like to video or text chat with me?
flu. i think you a probably right. body aches not as common with covid. if no significant sob follow the following: https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines/self-quarantine-guide talk to your provider flu test may help, but management typically best conservative. certainly if worseing sob be seen. remeber at 29 risk for severe infection is low either way. .
medications. i am unaware of any contraindications to either ibuprofen or paracetamol. you can take either. when i get sick i like to take both. one can be taken every 4 hours and the other every 6 hours. .

virus. you have a viral respiratory tract infection and the absence of fever is reassuring at this time. should fever or shortness of breath develop and if you're in an area where covid 19 is present, you should then call your md for instructions. for now, drink adequate fluids, gargle with warm salt water. i also recommend using zinc lozenges and take acetaminophen. .

it will.... but it will take some time to break the chain of infection, to find a cure, and to find a vaccine. it is stressful for everyone. one way to look at it is that we are all in this together, irregardless of political party, race, or religion. as a people, we can overcome a simple virus and be stronger as a whole. you are not alone, millions of others share your concerns. hang in there....

in brief: if you meet criteria you should test if you meet the criteria for testing, which currently states that you should have symptoms (cough/fever/shortness of breath/sore throat) plus contact with a confirmed or suspected case of covid-19. if you do not have a contact, then best would be to isolate yourself (which you will be doing on lockdown anyway). would you like to video or text chat with me?

in brief: vitamin c while getting enough vitamin c in your diet is highly recommended, it has no special ability to prevent coronavirus or flu virus. best preventative measures for these are frequent handwashing and avoiding people with sneezing/coughing/cold symptoms and fevers.
hello,ct scan is diagnostic for interstitial lung disease (ild). it can develop after the age of 60 years especially if the patient is having bronchitis and recurrent pneumonia.yes, you are right about survival. it is not having a good prognosis.but, now day’s newer treatments like pirfenidone and n acetylcysteine (nac) drugs are available. so consult pulmonologist and discuss these newer treatments.hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards,dr. kaushal bhavsar

no. it is currently not possible but hopefully house to house testing coming according to cyril ramaphosa last night. you can get tested at some clinics, safest right now is to stay at home unless you are imminently unwell. if safe and in as much isolation as possible you can be tested at lancet and ampath, due to capacity stretching they are now only testing people who fit the criteria. .
be very cautious . there is not a lot of information on children with covid-19 but definitely would try to protect this child especially and consult the doctor asap if child develops fever and shortness of breath.
in brief: symptoms if you are not having troubles breathing best to self-isolate. follow the following guidelines: https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines/preventing-covid-19probably worthwhile to first isolate yourself: guidelines as follow: https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines/self-quarantine-guideif you are not having significant sob covid should be mild for you. would you like to video or text chat with me?

hey,minimal linear atelectasis doesn't mean pneumonia of lung, but still if you are diagnosed as pneumonia then it's ok.and yes tiredness is expected for 4-5 days at least.
yes. there are many causes of shortness of breath. covid-19 may be one cause and is not necessarily associated with cough. fever is one prominent symptom, but the absence of fever does not rule out the infection. .
covid. for most people the infection can last up to two weeks. in people who get particularly ill the infection last 4 to 6 weeks. .
uncertain data. hello.the data available about the coronavirus and ibuprofen are inconclusive.nevertheless you should visit a pain specialist doctor for the manage of your pain. it's been established that ibuprofen and other nsaid's taken in large doses or long periods cause kidney damage.
in brief: life is not exact in pandemic times, supplies are short. life is not that exact. that means 57.6% is fine, and if a person catches the coronavirus, it won't be because she was missing 2% on her hand sanitizer. remember that the virus goes from person to person. if there are no people close by, and if the high-touch surfaces like table tops, keyboards, or doorknobs are clean, then one is a lot safer. (mar. 2020) would you like to video or text chat with me?
hard to say. in the absence of treatment i guess we grasp at things. this is definitely doing the rounds but as yet unproven. most people recover from covid. so very very hard to trial. most important right now is not to spread it. so stay home. wash hands.
in brief: sort of if you are having sex with someone who has covid-19 you are quite at risk of getting it. high likelihood if kissing and having intercourse but it may not be transmitted through intercourse but the closeness in an intimate situation like that with someone who is infected gives a high likelihood of transmission.
respected user , hiwarm welcome to healthcaremagic.comi have gone through your concern in depth .* levofloxacin is best effective molecule for pneumonia and many intestine bugs .* metronidazole may be kept reserved on waiting for certain test reports or clinically physician may not need to add to the drug cart according to the evaluation and clinical experience .hope this clears your doubt .regards .
see your physician. your personal physician can give you this letter. this forum is for answering general medical/dental questions.

delay/virtual . virtual get togethers should be considered. keep a distance of at least 6 feet between persons who are not in your household. .
virtual consult. best to do a virtual consult, you can through this platform. testing is the only way to know. self isolation is very important right now unless you need urgent medical care. .
without any details it's impossible to say.
in brief: not necessarily you need to consult an endocrinologist for advice about diet, weight control, and medication for controlling a1c. it is not feasible to provide more useful suggestions without talking to you, performing physical examination and may be some test.wish you good health! would you like to video or text chat with me?
hiyes it might be but not completely.to be sure she should consult her doctor for further follow up.wishes dr.jolanda
in brief: basics fever is a normal body response when ill that increases circulation & oxygen supply to the tissues so natural healing comes faster.i would never treat minor fevers around 38 nor would i alternate fever meds. one or the other would be all i use when needed. new data supports avoiding all ibuprofen products when corona virus may be present. would you like to video or text chat with me?

in brief: great question not sure if you need to worry about your shoes, but it won't hurt. in my house, we take off shoes and outside clothes at the door after we enter. the clothes go immediately into the laundry, we wash our hands with soap and water, then put on "house clothes". different from "public" clothes. we try to prevent the potential introduction of the virus into out home. once inside, everything is clean. would you like to video or text chat with me?
no. coronavirus is the name of a family of viruses, but each one can cause disease.coronavirus covid-19 is one specific virus linked to the present pandemic, not a mixture of viruses.
keycare flu vaccine. hiplease contact your medical aid to see if meet the qualifying criteria to be covered by a flu vaccine on your plan. usually keycare only covers in patients that are high risk, like asthmatics, diabetes, emphysema, cardiac patients etc.the current flu vaccine does not protect you against covid19 and will not influence you ability to respond to this infection.
it could. only way to know is to test, self isolate :)
in brief: overseas and covid yes,direct contact with anyone from europe and travel history must get tested. there are drive in facilities in johannesburg.check the net for testing places in ct would you like to video or text chat with me?

nsaids. otc nsaids can help with pain and inflammation. please try calling a local oral surgeon. most medical offices are open for emergencies only, and this probably falls into that category.

hello and welcome to ‘ask a doctor’ service.  i have reviewed your query and here is my advice.  yes, you are right. if you don't pay attention in common cold, it can complicate as pneumonia. so follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in common cold.  1. drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. 2. do warm water gargles and steam inhalation 4-5 times a day. 3. avoid cold foods like ice cream, cold drinks etc. 4. take treatment for common cold regularly. 5. watch for persistent fever, chest pain, yellowish green expectoration, breathing difficulty etc. if any of these symptom appears then immediately get done chest x ray. 6. avoid smoking and alcohol if you have these habits.  hope i have answered your query.  let me know if i can assist you further.
exam needed. you are assuming that the discomfort is coming from both lungs, but pain of pleurisy or pneumonia wouldn't come and go in different sites. i doubt your symptoms are lung related, but fever, chills, sweats, worse cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, warrant testing.. if you've been exposed to someone with covid, or if you or someone you were exposed to travelled to an affected region, get tested.
yes. yes you should come but it will not be a consultation depending the treatment you taking. if it is for hiv you will need to go to the lab for for bloods and if it is for hormone replacement there is no need for consultation but either way you have to call the practice reception to check f dr is available.
? test. do you have access to testing? if so perhaps do a telephonic consult ? and get tested and self isolate ? usually anosmia - loss of smell is an early warning sign but close contact to someone who is positive it's highly contagious.
shout . what are your symptoms? there are short supply of tests and only if you absolutely need a test at this stage. stay at home, disinfect everything especially any shopping coming from outside your home. ask questions on this forum. stay at home right now.
thanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. best treatment of pneumonia is identification of causative pathogen and start appropriate antibiotics. so get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. culture report will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. so consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.
in brief: if you meet criteria you should test if you meet the criteria for testing, which currently states that you should have symptoms (cough/fever/shortness of breath/sore throat) plus contact with a confirmed or suspected case of covid-19. if you do not have a contact, then best would be to isolate yourself (which you will be doing on lockdown anyway). would you like to video or text chat with me?
hi there . hi there, if there’s any other symptom like fever, shortness of breath you should get tested and seek medical atention however you should call your local emergency line for covid and stay away from hospitals, and follow oms guidelines please .
in brief: covid-19 and asthma great question. yes asthma is a chronic lung disease which carries some increased risk with covid-19. good asthma control along with good handwashwng, social distancing avoiding unnecessary travel along with your young age should keep your risk of complications low. smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity or compromised immune system are also risk factors to be considered.
not a bad idea. many pharmacists also are trying to work from home whenever possible. your best reference going forward will be your obs-gyn doc and based on your institution's flexibility and further government regulations either work from home, if possible, or go in maternity leave.
in brief: incubation period 2-14 days(time from exposure to time of getting illness). i am unclear if the doctor is positive or your husband is?you should isolate yourselves at home for 14 days.if your husband is positive,he should be in his own room and own bathroom,if possible.testing only recommended if there are symptoms(fever or cough or shortness of breath)and then you should be tested.good hand washing/no touching face would you like to video or text chat with me?
death. at your age the risk of death is the following: 0.1–0.2. if your diabetes is controlled your risk should not be markedly worse. make sure you follow appropriate gudelines. neve a guarantee, but your risk of serious problem is still pretty low. .
diabetes. my answer would be controlled or not. type 1 or 2 if managed well and treated can still maintain good immunity. if either are out of control then infections of any type more likely. .
in brief: symptoms glad you are not ignoring your symptoms. follow the following guidelines: https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines/self-quarantine-guide. keep in mind that the virus will very likely be of lesser course in someone your age. best to isolate and do the things you would normally do to treat the flu- rest, fluids and antipyretics if needed. if you would get particularly sob be seen. would you like to video or text chat with me?
in brief: no. it is not... yet that new is based in a paper (https://journals. plos.org/plospathogens/article?
in brief: check with pcp. data emerging from preliminary studies in france suggest a decades old medicine, chloroquine may be useful as a preventative drug. it has been used to prevent malaria for decades & manufactures in the us have announced they are increasing production to meet an expected demand. your status & what they are doing in your country should be answered by your doc. would you like to video or text chat with me?
socially isolate. get pleanty of fluids and rest and avoid others call dr if fever or difficulty breathing.
in brief: ingrown toenail an ingrown toenail can make your foot numb. i do er and it is a procedure i will do. however, many primary providers will do the procedure and podiatrists are a good choice. i do not recommend digging into it at home. however, to prevent future toenail problems do not wear pointed shoes, and let toenails grow to tip of toe and keep at that length. would you like to video or text chat with me?
risk. high risk would be smoker, 60 or older and with medical conditions- heart, lung, kidney. if you are not having significant sob self isolation best to do and treat for flu symtpoms-rest, fluids, tylenol or ibuprofen if needed. https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines/self-quarantine-guide. tests are being reserved for those with significant symptoms. .

in brief: any contagiousness a person with any signs of respiratory infection or gastrointestinal infection should be isolated to prevent spread of his infection. allergies can cause symptoms similar to infection symptoms, which means a person with allergy symptoms at this pandemic time should also be isolated. note that if every person is isolated for 3-4 weeks, the pandemic stops because virus transmission stops.

thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern. pneumonia is lung infection. if not treated appropriately, it can cause generalized sepsis in the body.this sepsis can damage other vital organs like kidney, heart, liver etc. since her chest x ray is worsening after 7 days of antibiotic and her kidneys are also-ran showing problem, possibility of severe pneumonia with sepsis is more likely.best treatment of pneumonia is identification of causative pathogen and start appropriate treatment. for this bronchoscopy and bal (bronchoalveolar lavage) is needed. bal culture and sensitivity should be done. culture report will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. so discuss about bronchoscopy and bal with your doctor. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your girlfriend. thanks.
thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern.pneumonia can recur.so better to first rule out pneumonia for your symptoms.so get done chest x ray.if chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for pneumonia or other lung disease.take simple painkiller like paracetamol or ibuprofen. apply warm water pad on affected areas.you will mostly improve with all these.hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.

hello and welcome to ‘ask a doctor’ service. i have reviewed your query and here is my advice.  pneumonia can cause pleurisy (inflammation of pleura) and this can cause similar kind of pain. so in my opinion, you should first get the chest x-ray done. if the chest x-ray is worsening, then your pain is due to pneumonia and you will need higher antibiotics. but if the chest x-ray is improving, then possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely. so apply warm water pad on the affected areas. avoid movements causing pain. avoid sudden jerky movements of the chest. take simple painkillers and muscle relaxant drugs like ibuprofen and thiocolchicoside. don't worry, you will be alright with all these.   hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.
seek evaluation. difficult to advise without more information, so seek evaluation by a doctor. because of covid, try to do that by phone/telemedicine. however, seek in person care right away if breathing distress, or severe symptoms.seek covid testing if known covid-19 contact, or travel to high risk country, or you’ve been in facility treating people with covid-19, or if pneumonia.call 0800 029 999 for test.
hello welcome to hcm. i have gone through your history. you have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and i suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. as you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. so you must not have any issues with exercise. with every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. this will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. you should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.regarding naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so i advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.wishing you good health. regards
in brief: if it's just from... if cough and headache are just from a mild cold, then the over-the-counter cold medicines are what people usually try. however, some illnesses such as strep throat, the flu, or pandemic coronavirus also have these same symptoms, but need evaluation. it is best to contact one's primary care doctor by video or phone first during this pandemic. for emergencies, call the local emergency #). (3/24/20) would you like to video or text chat with me?
in brief: diabetes type 1 diabetes may be an autoimmune disorder, but if well controlled one's immunity and ability to handle infections should be ok. poorly controlled diabetics, especially with complications of kidney disease and vascular disorders, degrees of dehydration and poor tissue status are at risk for infections partly because the skin barrier to pathogens is impaired. in my experience most type 1's do ok would you like to video or text chat with me?
hello yes i agree with the treatment its ok continue it as the doctor gad prescribed it for you regards dr.jolanda
thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern. possibility of pneumonia is very less because you are not having chest pain, mucus expectoration and your fever is also gone.so drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. avoid oily and spicy food. avoid junk food. avoid hard to chew food. take levocetrizine and paracetamol combination twice daily. do warm water gargles and steam inhalation 4-5 times a day. don't worry, you will be alright with all these. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.
correct. every bit helps.
rhd. if your rheumatic heart disease hasn't caused weakness of the heart muscle or cardiac arrhythmia it shouldn't predispose you to more complications than anyone else in good health. keep your resistance and immune system high by avoiding fatigue, dehydration, excessive stress, poor nutrition and exposure to ill people. practice social distancing. at sign of sore throat gargle with warm salt water .
avoid contact. stay at home for at least 7 days from the onset or symptoms, or for at least three days following fever whichever is longer in duration. cover your cough, monitor your temperature. watch for signs of worsening including fever, shortness of breath or worsening cough.
in brief: call a doctor most places require a doctor to order this, but check into your local healthcare services to see if there is way for you to be tested without that, good luck. there are criteria in most places to qualify for testing, so look into that to see if you qualify, ask your doctor... would you like to video or text chat with me?
test if you can. if you have access test, or consult telephonically don't go to a public space.
in brief: yes my opinion is yes, but the criteria for testing is quite stringent right now. perhaps telephonically consult your doctor if possible to discuss more fully. my opinion would be to access testing. would you like to video or text chat with me?

real vs. textbook. real-life criteria is different because we don't have enough tests, supplies, or medical staff around the world at this time (march 2020). textbook criteria are suspected covid in hospitalized persons or in those with underlying medical conditions; or persons who got symptoms less than 14 days after (1) contact with a suspect or confirmed covid patient or (2) travel through high-risk covid area.
in brief: coronavirus and acei. recent publications including the one from the lancet showed covid-19 binds to ace-2 receptor on target cells for entrance. the expression of ace-2 receptor is substantially increased in patients with diabetes who were treated with ace inhibitors or arb. nsaids has the similar effect. all medications can have some unexpected side effects. would you like to video or text chat with me?

thanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. your symptoms are seen with both, bronchitis and pneumonia. and both of these them are common after upper respiratory tract infection (urti - sinusitis). so better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and pft (pulmonary function test). chest x ray is needed for the diagnosis of pneumonia. pft is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for pneumonia. inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ics) are the mainstay of treatment for bronchitis. so first diagnose android then start appropriate treatment.. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.
in brief: symptoms vary. some may have no symptoms at all. some can be life threatening. would you like to video or text chat with me?
virus. symptoms could be either influenza or the covid 19 virus. call your local doctor to discuss these new changes in your health to determine what testing will,be needed, and steps you should take. at least for,now, treat the symptoms with acetaminophen (not ibuprofen) , cough syrup. isolate yourself away from other people, wear a mask to avoid spreading virus, sneeze into elbow, wash hands frequently.
coronavirus testing. yes, get tested if symptomatic (early symptoms could be mild respiratory symptoms and nonspecific) or self quarantine given your high risk of exposure. .
no. don't go to work you could unknowinly spread the virus. we are all effectively on lock down and the sooner the better if you think you have it stay home, if you ave access to testing then get tested but we are running out of tests (to my knowledge) if you deteriorate send a message here and i will advise. do not go to work.
in brief: yes this virus clings to everything especially hairs. either wash your beard a few times a day and spray with alcohol or shave off.

in brief: yes: not wheezing but difficulty of breathing is a symptom of the corona virus infection but it is not the common one. it can be seen sometimes. the common symptoms are fever and cough mostly dry cough. the wheezing could be due to asthma or allergies in general. since covid 19 can be seen even without any symptoms i suggest you to get in touch with your doctor for advise and follow up with you. would you like to video or text chat with me?
screen sputum. you may have a bacterial illness such as bronchitis, pneumonia or a sinus infection. your pcp may collect sputum, screen for strep/influenza. covid-19 is usually associated with a dry cough, but secondary infection may occur. please see your pcp.

in brief: same as usual during this covid-19 pandemic, the other infections like colds, flus, and sinus infections can still happen. the over-the-counter treatments have not changed. covid-19 virus is so new that there has not been much verified research yet, so stick with what meds worked in the past. see the blog post...  https://www.healthtap.com/blog/post/selfcare-guide-and-local-coronavirus-resources (3/25/20) would you like to video or text chat with me?

good question. awareness and precautions are important, but your wife plays a valuable role for those who have contracted the disease. she will be at higher risk than the general population and we are seeing hcps contracting covid-19. there is no one correct answer to this question because situations vary. best option is for your wife to discuss this with her employer and take precautions. good luck!

in pandemic times... the covid-19 infection is worldwide, in all but some isolated areas. the goal is to keep people separate so that the clinics and hospitals are not overwhelmed. patients with medical symptoms should see their primary care doctor on video or by phone, and get instructed to go to a clinic or er only if not treatable by video or phone. symptoms of covid-19 are often the same as a cold or the flu.
hi hope to satisfy youactually there is an viral infection there must be superimposed bacteria infection too.viral resolves with the passage of time on its own but to treat bacterial one we have to give antibiotics.for pneumonia you should give her azithromycin according to her weight 10 mg /kg wight once a day and for 5 days.plz mention the age n weight for next onwards.also give ibuprofen 10 mg /kg weight three times a day for 3 days n for nasal congestion give give arinac syrup twice a day for 7 days.hope she feels better soon.

thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern. yes, if we treat fistula, drain pus and fluid and cure pneumonia, her breathing will be eased.since she is bone marrow transplant patient, possibility of atypical bacterial infection is more likely because of immunosuppression.so get done bronchoscopy and bal culture. also get done fluid culture and sensitivity report. culture report will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. by these, we can achieve faster recovery. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your sister. thanks.
