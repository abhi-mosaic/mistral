SUBJECT: intermittent breathing and coughing problem from over-use of steroids MESSAGE: My husband was a patient at [LOCATION].  If I understand correctly his room-mate (an older gentleman) had come up for help from West Virginia for what I believe to be the following problem:  he has taken steroids for a protracted period of time and the steroids have caused the following problems in his life: weakness of his leg muscles and additionally he has an intermittent problem with wheezing/coughing/breathing however the [LOCATION] specialists just could not find the cause or how to resolve it.  The "lung symptoms" if I understand correctly are suppressed by the steroids to some degree but the steroids are causing problem which I mention above.  Might you have a data base about such problems?   I also am asking if there are any antidotes to the muscle weakness he has from the steroids.  Thanks

Hi All, I am from India and really worried. I have a 6 months old baby girl. I have read the article on Lactose intolerance. She is unable to digest any formula milk or any milk products. When she was a new born, I started giving her Lactogen (a formula milk) a little bit along with my milk. She was fine with it but after 3 weeks, I switched her to another formula milk named Nan Pro 0 which is for babies upto 1 year. She started drinking that along with my breast milk. After 2 weeks, she started getting Diarrhea and a severe one where she pooped at least 15 times in one day. Therefore, I consulted the doctor and the doctor immediately asked me to put her on breast milk only. I did try that but she was hungry and crying therefore, I gave her a little bit of formula milk aswell. She was file with all the medicines. However, once the medicine stooped, she again started getting diarrhea. This continued on and off. After a while, the doctor asked me to stop the formula milk and start giving her Zerolac (soy milk) along with breast feeding. I did that and everything smoothened. However, after 2 months, I asked my doctor if we can start giving her any type of milk apart from zerolac as I was concerned about her getting calcium in her body with having milk. The doctor asked me to give her formula milk (Nan Pro 0). I did that but just after half an hour, she suddenly started vomiting which continued till she had the milk in her stomach. Once that stopped, she started getting diarrhea which continued till 3 days. She was put back on Zerolac again and breast milk. As she is now 6 months old, I thought of giving Cerelac to her but again she did not digest it and went through the same problem again. I am unable to find the right doctor here in India where I live. Please help my daughter in this situation. Please let me know the contact detail may be an email address of any doctor with whom I can discuss my case. Please help us. Thanks for all your help. Regards, [cid:

I am always tired. Recently I've been getting pains in my stomache and feeling sick. Does any of this sound like Lupus?? I've tested negative for it before, but the more I read about it I feel that's what i could have. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

SUBJECT: Mayonnaise and food poisoning MESSAGE: I have researched many other sites that say that mayonnaise is a safe food and that it is a myth that it causes food poisoning.  It seems to get a bad rap because it is used in combination with other items that cause food poisoning.  Some sites insist that it can even prevent the onslaught of bacterial growth, thus helping to ward off food poisoning because of its acidic nature.  Apparently it often used to be made at home, with eggs, and the eggs would go bad.....mayonnaise has thus carried this stigma ever since.  But many sites insist it is safe.  I was wondering what you think of these findings?   Thank you!

I understand that you cannot provide opinions,nor suggest, any type of therpy.  My son (dob-[DATE]), was called back to the hospital four days after birth due to a abnormal PKU, which suggested adrenal hyperplasia. After test the endocrine physians felt he did not have the condition. Several years later he began having severe headaches preceded by violent vomiting epidodes  that lasted for hours. When he was admitted to [LOCATION],  he was suffering from bleeding esphogal ulcers,  and severe dehydration and, malnutrician. His urine (24 hr), blood plasma,& VMA,showed increased values of catacholomines.He also demostrated intermittent hypertension, and tachcardia through out the day (he had been diagnoised with ADHD several years earlier). His MIGB clearly showed bifocal uptake in both adrenal glands. The mri did not show tumors at that time ([DATE]. He has since been diagnoised with antral polys (biosphy's taken were misplaced, and the gastrologist would not redo the test), aberrant right subclavian artery,  esphogas pushed to the side, low oxygen intake, high levels of gastrin, cyclic vomiting syndrome, severe sinus attacks that come and go, without infection present.  His symptons that I have not already include heat intolerence, pallor, poor appetite with little weight gain, anxiety, tremor of hands, and stomach pain. After his mri, which I was told would take about 45mins, took over 5 hrs. Since then we have been having no luck with finding doctors that will take my son as a patient. Are you able to suggest a hospital that is knowlegable with pheochromocytomas? My son's father is mia, but during our 7 yrs together,  he also suffered severe headaches, and intermittent hypertension. He never followed up with a physian. Any help would be appreciated.

SUBJECT: how to breathe MESSAGE: Dear Sirs,  This may seem like a stupid question but here goes anyway.  I am 64 yrs old and a type II diabetic.  I walk frequently to stay fairly fit but always seem to get out of breath when going up even gentle hills. Today however I noticed that I could change how I breath. Thus, I could force air out using my diaphram (ie like blowing out a candle)then relax and just let the air flow back in or I could use my diaphram to suck in air (like breathing in the morning air)and again relax my diaphram to push it out. I also found that I could breath faster under conscious control which seemd to help my performance. I dont know if any of this makes sense to you but I would like to know what you think and whether there are any do's and dont's and if there is a 'better' way to breath.  Thanks very much for your help with this,  Regards,  [NAME]

MESSAGE: Hi,I hope you can help me with my query, but if not, maybe you can point me in the right direction.I currently suffer from lower abdominal adhesions, that were diagnosed and separated in January 2013, but have since returned.To combat the pain, I have begun an application to get a neurostymulation device inserted into my lower back.However, the main reason why I am contacting you is for a second opinion on whether or not I will have difficulty or if I can pregnant. Would it be advisable to avoid pregnancy? Please know that we have always talked about adoption, so it is not the end of the world if I can't have my own kids.Also, I was told that my adhesions were caused by an appendectomy (appendix had not ruptured) I had in 2004, but as it was all keyhole surgery, I don't understand why? Please note that they also removed a small cist from both the ovaries and bowel at the the same time. I am prone to small ovarian cists that come and go on their own (most of the time).Can you help with my questions?Many Thanks for any information you have,Kind Regards,[NAME]

Cross Eye.  Need to fix my cross eyed
Crainosynstosis. My 2.5 year old daughter has this condition with the metoptic, Sagittal and bi-coronals sutures prematurely fusing.

Metformin varieties.  As of today, I have been on Metformin HCL 500MG twice a day, for two weeks now. Was diagnosed via 495 blood sugar result and now down to 180 this morning. Pills were prescribed from ER as I have no doctor of my own and awaiting ACA insurance. My friend gave me two bottles of Metformin her mother had used before she died, and I was wondering if I could take them myself.   The first is (according to the label on the bottle) GLIP/METFORM2.5-500MTAB TEVA USA, ONE BY MOUTH EVERY DAY WITH A MEAL. The pill is white, flat sides, oval shaped, and has 7456 on one side and 93 on the other.   The second says GLYB/METFORM 2.5/500TAB ACTAV MID Generic for GLUCOVANCE 2.5/500 TAB. TAKE TWO TABLETS BY MOUTH IN THE MORNING AND THEN TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH IN THE EVENING. This pill is about the same size as the above listed pill, but with what looks like P., then 752. Nothing is on the opposite side.  I have to ask this because while I am waiting for my insurance to kick in, I cannot get a refill on the Metformin HCL I am taking now since I have no doctor to go through. So, if these extras I was given are just as generic as mine, can I take them? Would I adjust the dosage? And, if so, how should I take them (dosage and how many a day)? Being poor sucks, so I hope you can help me out... Thanks!  [NAME]

I need to know if the pramipexole made by your company has a "something - sulfite" as a stablizing ingredient. This is what, seems, oddly, to be causing swelling of my hands, feet, nose, throat, eyelids and tongue. Could I get an email or a drug package insert so I could find out all the inactive ingredients.

SUBJECT: Levalbuterol and Budesonide Inhalation Products MESSAGE: After calling TEVA Pharmaceuticals, they relayed that the stability and storage information printed on their Levalbuterol 1.25 mg/3 mL and 0.63 mg/3 mL Inhalation Solution, as well as their Budesonide 0.5 mg/2 mL and 0.25 mg/2 mL Inhalation Suspension packages is information directly pulled from DailyMed, hence NIH. I am trying to determine if there is any extended stability information for either product, as the nebs are not singly packaged, and therefore a significant amount of product is being wasted in our facility due to the information provided. When name brand Xopenex was still available, Sepracor was able to provide our facility with more stablity information that enabled us to refrigerate the product in the foil pouch, continuing to protect it from light: i.e., "allows use of product through its labeled expiry." It would be greatly appreciated if some additional information could be provided regarding the above situation. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Okay, so for about a year or two I've had chronic depression, insomnia, migraines, mistaking stomache problems as something worse, and having issues focusing on many of things. At first i thought i had ADD because ive never been tested for it, and because im young and dumb i took 2 pills of aderol because i was having very bad issues focusing. It worked and i was able to focus way better, but seeing all of these symptoms makes me think its not ADD. I'm only 16 years old, and I've just started getting tired of going through this every day of my life! So based on on all of this information I've provided you, do you believe that I may have GAD and should talk fo my doctor, or does it sound like something different?

Many of us have a fear of getting an asymptomatic, insideous perforation in the digestive tract -- one that leads to vague complaints or even degenerative conditions but doesn't announce itself in any acute way.  Can this ever happen?  And if it does, how can a patient detect it?  There are stories of people swallowing needles and they don't even know it! One answer I've heard put forward is that foreign objects embedded in tissue become encased in some kind of hard flesh and somehow eliminated from the body.  Could this really happen?  Is there something I could read about it?  What about the people who have found foreign objects still sitting around in their tissues after aeons? I'm one of those internet worry-worts.  I go to online forums where people really want to know the worst case scenario for things like this.  This particular issue has worried me for years.  Thanks for discussing it with me. [NAME]

I have been in contact with the paediatrician who used to be in charge of that child but she is unfortunately on long term sick.  Would you be able to give me some information on this condition with key features please? Are there behavioural, coordination, sensory difficulties, etc...that can be associated with it?

SUBJECT: Rehabbing a finger that was splinted MESSAGE: I badlydislocated my finger 7 weeks ago.  I reset it myself as it happened late in the evening. I splinted it myself with a store-bought splint because of concern for a break as well as ligament damage.  I just went to see an orthopedic doctor for the first time today (yes, I'm kicking myself for not going earlier).  The X-ray showed that the finger is still offset somewhat, perhaps indicating that some of the ligaments were ruptured. (The bone was ok.  I guess we won't know if it was ever broken.)  Nonetheless, I have to see a surgeon for an opinion in a few days.  Meanwhile, there is still some swelling and the ring finger that was in the splint is out but stiff as a board.  I'm concerned and not sure what possibilities to expect.  I certainly know you won't know what the situation is or what the surgeon will say but I was curious (a) what possibilities I might expect and (b) how problematic it is that the finger is so stiff...should I expect to regain motion...can it be rehabbed?  I'm assuming so, and if so, how long does it take to regain motion from a finger that has been splinted for so long?

Passing on a genetic condtion. My son is affected with an autosomal recessive genetic condition - Senior Loken Syndrome.  His brother is not affected.  1) What are the chances that my affected son's kids will have this disorder, and 2) how does my other son know if he is a carrier? Many thanks for responding.  I searched, but could not find an answer to this.  I did find this: Autosomal recessive inheritance: Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene for an autosomal recessive disorder (carriers) have a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. The chance with each pregnancy of having an unaffected child who is a carrier of the disorder is 50 percent, and the chance that a child will not have the disorder and will not be a carrier is 25 percent (illustration). ~[NAME]

He suggested me some pain killers and advised me to wear anklet. I have been following the instruction since then; I went to another doctor who advised me to go for physiotherapy (Short Wave Diathermy) and advised me some exercises. I have been following them too. But yet now, I have not been fully recovered from the pain. Especially when I try to walk quickly or try to put pressure with my left leg, I feel pain. I am very tensed about this. Can you please suggest me how to overcome the pain. Thanks.
